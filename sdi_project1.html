<p>This is a simple story of me and my pet turtle, and what I do when his water is dirty.  It involves changing his water, rinsing his rocks, and refilling the aquarium with water and a few chemicals to keep it clean.</p>
<p>Chomper is a yellow-bellied slider turtle.  I've had him for three years and he's getting pretty big.  For those of you who don't know, you need to sign a waiver when you buy a turtle saying you will use them for "educational purposes," - which basically means you need to have the whole aquarium set up.</p>
<p>But Chomper does like when his water is clean.</p>
